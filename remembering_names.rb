Brief -

As a student
So that I can remember people's names
I want an IRB application that stores the names of people I meet

Step 1 - Imagine how to use it
  > remember_name("Name")
  => return "Name Stored!"
  > show_names
  => ["Name"]
  > remember_name("Name2")
  => return "Name Stored!"
  > show_names
  => ["Name", "Name2"]
